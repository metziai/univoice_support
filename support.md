## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How do I start using UniVoice?**  
A: Launch the app, select your input and output languages, choose a mode, and tap "Start."

**Q: Do I need an account to use it?**  
A: No, you can start using the app immediately with a free trial as a guest — no sign-in required.

However, creating an account offers several benefits:

✅ Sync usage across devices (iPhone, iPad, etc.)

✅ Purchase additional time and restore it anytime

✅ Preserve your remaining time, even if you uninstall or switch devices

🔄 Guest Time Migration
If you’ve used the app as a guest and later choose to sign in, we’ll offer to migrate your remaining trial time to your account — as long as your email is verified. This ensures your remaining access isn’t lost and becomes available across devices.

You’ll see a "Sync Guest Time?" prompt after signing in. Simply confirm to transfer your time to the newly created account.

**Q: 🗑️ What if I delete my account?**
A: For privacy and security, we comply with data deletion policies. If you delete your account:

!!All purchased or migrated time will be permanently erased.!!

This action cannot be undone.

**Q: Why can't I hear translated speech?**  
A: Make sure external audio (e.g. Bluetooth headset) is connected. Also check system volume and permissions.

**Q: Where are my saved transcripts?**  
A: You can export transcripts manually using the download button in each mode’s full-screen view.
